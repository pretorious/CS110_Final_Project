Java Based GUI Implementation of the card game "War"

For this last homework assignment you will be creating a GUI-based implementation of the kid’s card game, War. If you
are unfamiliar with the game, you can learn about the game here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_%28card_game%29
There are some variations in the way the game is played. 

For our implementation, when a “war” occurs:
Both players play the next one card of their pile, face down, and then another face up
If a player runs out of cards during a war, they will immediately lose

Design decisions are yours to make; you will be graded on these design decisions. The only requirement is that you must
use inheritance at least once (outside of the GUI implementation).
